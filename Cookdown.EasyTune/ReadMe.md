**Easy Tune**:

Finally! A fast, simple way to tune all of your management packs and solve the problem of alert noise.

If you’ve ever spent days explaining to teams what’s monitored on their servers and hours implementing overrides only to be told that SCOM is still too noisy, you’ll know why we created Easy Tune.

SCOM is known for management packs that provide in-depth monitoring for Microsoft and other enterprise technologies, but often the management packs offer too much detail. To be successful with SCOM, you have to tune SCOM.

Key benefits
- Enables you to apply best practices created by the community
- Makes it easy to explain what level of monitoring was applied to any workload
- Removes the need for creating overrides one at a time
- Avoids the sprawl of overrides across multiple management packs
